# PerspectiveGame


Its a bit messy but feel free to use my codes, But please do give me credit if you were to use it. :)


Brief Explanation:

This is a first person perspective opitcal illusion puzzle game. I was heavily inspired by games like Superliminal and Viewfinder, so I wanted to try recreate it. One of the game feature is to align the picture to the view and the intended object interection will be activated. 

I'm still trying to  improving it. One of the main problem is the difficulty of aligning the picture. Its really hard to align the picture 100% to the view. I'm thinking of aligning the picture to a blank wall/canvas and just create the object itself instead of editing the object in game.
(e.g old feature (align the picture of a opened door to the view, once allgined, the closed door becomes open [Look at my portfolio for the gif example]. Player has to aligned to a specific spot)  --->  new feature (Align the picture to a blank canvas, once alligned, create a door at the location. This allows the player to create the door anywhere on the blank wall as long as the pciture is alligned within the wall based on the player view.))
